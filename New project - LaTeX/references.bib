  abstract = {The Stock market forecasters focus on developing a successful approach to predict stock prices. The vital idea to successful stock market prediction is not only achieving best results but also to minimize the inaccurate forecast of stock prices. This paper attempts to design and implement a predictive system for guiding stock market investment. The novelty of our approach is the combination of both sensex points and Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds for effective prediction. Our claim is that the sentiment analysis of RSS news feeds has an impact on stock market values. Hence RSS news feed data are collected along with the stock market investment data for a period of time. Using our algorithm for sentiment analysis, the correlation between the stock market values and sentiments in RSS news feeds are established. This trained model is used for prediction of stock market rates. In our experimental study the stock market prices and RSS news feeds are collected for the company ARBK from Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). Our experimental study has shown an improvement of 14.43\% accuracy prediction, when compared with the standard algorithm of ID3, C4.5 and moving average stock level indicator.},

  abstract = {Gathering public opinion by analyzing big social data has attracted wide attention
due to its interactive and real time nature. For this, recent studies have relied on both social media and sentiment analysis in order to accompany big events by tracking people’s behavior. In this paper, we propose an adaptable sentiment analysis approach that analyzes social media posts and extracts user’s opinion in real-time. The proposed approach consists of first constructing a dynamic dictionary of words’ polarity based on a selected set of hashtags related to a given topic, then, classifying the tweets under several classes by introducing new features that strongly fine-tune the polarity degree of a post. To validate our approach, we classified the tweets related to the 2016 US election. The results of prototype tests have performed a good accuracy in detecting positive and negative classes and their sub-classes.},

This project is about taking non quantifiable data such as financial news articles about a company and predicting its future stock trend with news sentiment classification. Assuming that news articles have impact on stock market, this is an attempt to study relationship between news and stock trend. To show this, we created three different classification models which depict polarity of news articles being positive or negative. Observations show that RF and SVM perform well in all types of testing. Naïve Bayes gives good result but not compared to the other two. Experiments are conducted to evaluate various aspects of the proposed model and encouraging results are obtained in all of the experiments. The accuracy of the prediction model is more than 80% and in comparison with news random labelling with 50% of accuracy; the model has increased the accuracy by 30%.},

  abstract = {As the number of textual data is exponentially increasing, it becomes more important to develop models to analyze the text data automatically. The texts may contain various labels such as gender, age, country, sentiment, and so forth. Using such labels may bring benefits to some industrial fields, so many studies of text classification have appeared. Recently, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been adopted for the task of text classification and has shown quite successful results. In this paper, we propose convolutional neural networks for the task of sentiment classification. Through experiments with three well-known datasets, we show that employing consecutive convolutional layers is effective for relatively longer texts, and our networks are better than other state-of-the-art deep learning models.},

  abstract      = {Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e., can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 87.6% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error by more than 6%.},

  abstract  = {Stock price forecasting is an important and thriving topic in financial engineering especially since new techniques and approaches on this matter are gaining ground constantly. In the contemporary era, the ceaseless use of social media has reached unprecedented levels, which has led to the belief that the expressed public sentiment could be correlated with the behavior of stock prices. The idea is to recognize patterns which confirm this correlation and use them to predict the future behavior of the various stock prices. With no doubt, though uninteresting individually, tweets can provide a satisfactory reflection of public sentiment when taken in aggregate. In this paper, we develop a system which collects past tweets, processes them further, and examines the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes Bernoulli classification and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for providing a positive or negative sentiment on the tweet corpus. Subsequently, we employ the same machine learning algorithms to analyze how tweets correlate with stock market price behavior. Finally, we examine our prediction's error by comparing our algorithm's outcome with next day's actual close price. Overall, the ultimate goal of this project is to forecast how the market will behave in the future via sentiment analysis on a set of tweets over the past few days, as well as to examine if the theory of contrarian investing is applicable. The final results seem to be promising as we found correlation between sentiment of tweets and stock prices.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, the use of social media has reached unprecedented levels. Among all social media, with its popular micro-blogging service, Twitter enables users to share short messages in real time about events or express their own opinions. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques on retrieved tweet corpus. A machine learning model is deployed to predict tweet sentiment, as well as gain an insight into the correlation between twitter sentiment and stock prices. Specifically, that correlation is acquired by mining tweets using Twitter's search API and process it for further analysis. To determine tweet sentiment, two types of machine learning techniques are adopted including Na\"{\i}ve Bayes classification and Support vector machines. By evaluating each model, we discover that support vector machine gives higher accuracy through cross validation. After predicting tweet sentiment, we mine historical stock data using Yahoo finance API, while the designed feature matrix for stock market prediction includes positive, negative, neutral and total sentiment score and stock price for each day. In order to capturing the correlation situation between tweet opinions and stock market prices, hence, evaluating the direct correlation between tweet sentiments and stock market prices, the same machine learning algorithm is implemented for conducting our empirical study.},

  abstract  = {There has been a recent swell of interest in the automatic identification and extraction of opinions, emotions, and sentiments in text. Motivation for this task comes from the desire to provide tools for information analysts in government, commercial, and political domains, who want to automatically track attitudes and feelings in the news and on-line forums. How do people feel about recent events in the Middle East? Is the rhetoric from a particular opposition group intensifying? What is the range of opinions being expressed in the world press about the best course of action in Iraq? A system that could automatically identify opinions and emotions from text would be an enormous help to someone trying to answer these kinds of questions.
Researchers from many subareas of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing have been working on the automatic identification of opinions and related tasks. To date, most such work has focused on sentiment or subjectivity classification at the document or sentence level. Document classification tasks include, for example, distinguishing editorials from news articles and classifying reviews as positive or negative. A common sentence-level task is to classify sentences as subjective or objective.
This paper presents a new approach to phrase-level sentiment analysis that first determines whether an expression is neutral or polar and then disambiguates the polarity of the polar expressions. With this approach, the system is able to automatically identify the contextual polarity for a large subset of sentiment expressions, achieving results that are significantly better than baseline.},
