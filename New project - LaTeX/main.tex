% \section*{Abstract} %the * says do not give a number
\begin{abstract}
\noindent
    A concise and factual abstract is required. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from an article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, references should be avoided. Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. The abstract is a short summary of your document as a whole. It is always suggested that your abstract should not be longer that 150 words.
    
    \bigskip %give some spacing between the abstract and keywords
    
    \textbf{{Keywords:}} \textit{Immediately after the abstract, provide a list of 5-10 keywords. Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes. Try \textbf{not} to use overly generic terms such as \textbf{Cyber Security}, \textbf{Digital Forensics}, or \textbf{Data Science}}
    
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

% This is the first paragraph
This is the first \textbf{paragraph}. The number one occurs quite often in this paragraph. I am labelling every paragraph with their number, with this being one.

% This is the second paragraph
This is now the second \textit{paragraph}.
% Comments inside the paragraph. Since there is no blank line, it says one paragraph.
I am using this text to indicate that we are now in the second paragraph.

% This is the third paragraph
Lastly, I am also writing the third and final \underline{paragraph}. Three paragraphs is all we need for this example. This is teaching you \LaTeX{} in three easy paragraphs. But with additional packages, we can \xout{not} do more.

\subsection{This is a subsection with bullet-points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Item One
    \item Item Two
\end{itemize}{}

\subsection{This is a subsection with enumeration}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Item One
    \item Item Two
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mathematics in LaTeX}

You can write mathematics inline in three different ways. The first way is $E=mc^2$, The second way is \(E=mc^2\), and the last way is \begin{math}E=mc^2\end{math}.\newline
This illustrates how you can write the equation on their own line. This looks a lot better.
\[E=mc^2\]
The above mentioned way is not used often, as it is better to have your equations numbered. The typical way maths is shown when it is numbered is as follows. \begin{equation}
    E=mc^2
\end{equation}{}

\noindent
There are also other ways where mathematics is much easier to write in \LaTeX{}. We write integrals using $\int$ and fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$.
\begin{equation}
    \int_0^1 \frac{1}{e^x} = \frac{e-1}{e}
\end{equation}

Lower case Greek letters are written as $\omega$ $\delta$ etc. While upper case Greek letters are written as $\Omega$ $\Delta$

Mathematical operators are prefixed with a backslash as $\sin(\beta)$, $\cos(alpha)$, $\log(x)$ etc.

\section{Explaining Figures}
Figures are one of the most complicated items in \LaTeX{}. Similar to all other things in \LaTeX{}, a figure has to begin and end somewhere. We will also need to upload the figure. The preferred format for \LaTeX{} is PDF or TIFF files.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Noroff.pdf}
    \caption{Noroff Logo}
    \label{fig:noroff_logo}
\end{figure}

As you can see in figure \ref{fig:noroff_logo}, this is the logo you encounter every time you are browsing social media. Figure \ref{fig:noroff_logo} is used by Noroffs marketing team even on page \pageref{fig:noroff_logo}.

\section{Explaining Tables}
Table are quite difficult to draw in \LaTeX{}, however, it is something that is needed quite often. Lets start by doing a very basic table.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\
    cell4 & cell5 & cell6 \\
    cell7 & cell8 & cell9
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Test table 1}
    \label{tab:test_table1}
\end{table}

There is a table, however, it does not look like a normal table. We are missing the lines. Let's add the lines to it now.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
    \hline
    cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\
    cell4 & cell5 & cell6 \\
    cell7 & cell8 & cell9 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Test table 2}
    \label{tab:test_table2}
\end{table}

\bigbreak

The last table, table \ref{tab:test_table3}, depicts the students at NUC that are sick of the online marketing campaign. There are many different ways how we can design it.
Something to note, the caption on a table is always \textbf{above} and the caption on a figure should always be \textbf{below} it.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Students marketing opinions}
    \begin{tabular}{|| c | c | c ||}
    \hline
    Location & Like & Dislike \\
    \hline
    \hline
    Oslo & 3 & 972 \\
    Kristiansand & 0 & 5486 \\
    Bergen & 1 & 875 \\
    \hline
    \hline
    Total & 4 & 7333 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:test_table3}
\end{table}
